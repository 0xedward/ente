# Releases

Create a PR to bump up the version number in `pubspec.yaml`.

Once that is merged, tag main and push the tag. This'll trigger a GitHub
workflow that:

* Creates a new draft GitHub release and attaches all the build artifacts to it
  (mobile APKs and various desktop packages),

* Creates a new release in the internal track on Play Store.

(TODO(MR): Fix this after the monorepo move) Xcode Cloud has already been
configured and will automatically build and release to TestFlight when step 1
was merged to main (you can see logs under the PR checks).

If you want to make changes to the workflow itself, or test it out, you can push
a tag like `auth-v1.2.3-test` (where v1.2.3 is the next expected version that'll
go out). For more details, see the comments on top of the [auth-release
workflow](.github/workflows/auth-release.yml).

Once the workflow completes, go to the draft GitHub release it that was created.
Use the "Generate release notes", providing it the suitable tag if needed. The
release notes generated by default will contain all PRs and new contributors
from all the releases in the monorepo, so you'll need to filter them to keep
only the things that relate to auth.
