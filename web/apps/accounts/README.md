# Ente Accounts

Code that runs on `accounts.ente.io`.

Passkeys are tied to domains, so this app serves as a common sharing point to
allow the passkey to be tied to the user's Ente account and be used by all our
other apps. For more details, see
[docs/webauthn-passkeys.md](../../docs/webauthn-passkeys.md).
