## Workflow

You can edit these files directly on GitHub and open a pull request. That is the
easiest workflow to get started without needing to install anything on your
local machine.

If you plan on contributing frequently, we recommend using an editor. VSCode is
a good choice. Also install the Prettier extension for VSCode, and set VSCode to
format on save. This will use the standard formatting and text wrapping options
for this project, so you can just focus on the content.

We currently don't enforce the prettier formatting to make it easy for people
unfamiliar with programming to also be able to make edits from GitHub directly.

This is a common theme - unlike the rest of the codebase where we expect some
baseline understanding of the tools involved, the docs are meant to be a place
for non-technical people to also provide their input. The reason for this is not
to increase the number of docs, but to bring more diversity to them. Such
diversity of viewpoints is essential for evolving documents that can be of help
to people of varying level of familiarity with tech.
