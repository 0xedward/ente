## Running

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Then start a local server

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Workflow

You can edit these files directly on GitHub and open a pull request. That is the
easiest workflow to get started without needing to install anything on your
local machine.

If you plan on contributing frequently, we recommend using an editor. VSCode is
a good choice. Also install the Prettier extension for VSCode, and set VSCode to
format on save. This way the editor will automatically format and wrap the text
using the project's standard, so you can just focus on the content.

Note that we currently don't enforce these formatting standards to make it easy
for people unfamiliar with programming to also be able to make edits from GitHub
directly.

This is a common theme - unlike the rest of the codebase where we expect some
baseline understanding of the tools involved, the docs are meant to be a place
for non-technical people to also provide their input. The reason for this is not
to increase the number of docs, but to bring more diversity to them. Such
diversity of viewpoints is essential for evolving documents that can be of help
to people of varying level of familiarity with tech.

If you're unsure about how to do something, just look around in the other files
and copy paste whatever seems to match the look of what you're trying to do. And
remember, writing docs should not be a chore, have fun!
