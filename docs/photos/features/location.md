# Location Tags: Search and Organize Your Photos

## Overview:
The Location Tags feature allows you to efficiently search and organize your photos based on their geographical location. Instead of sending your queries to our servers, we've implemented a privacy-friendly solution that runs searches locally on your device.

### Method 1: Adding Location Tags from a Photo
1. Open a photo.
2. Click on "Info."
3. Select "Add Location."
4. Enter the location name and define a radius.

### Method 2: Adding Location Tags from the Search Tab
