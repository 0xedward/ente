## Uncategoried

"Uncategorized" is a special album type where photos are automatically added under the following circumstances:

- When you remove a photo from the last album, it is relocated to "Uncategorized."
- During album deletion, if you choose to keep photos but delete the album, all photos exclusive to the current album are moved to the "Uncategorized" section.

Note: This does not include photos uploaded by others.



### Clean up Uncategorized

In the mobile app, you can click on the overflow menu and click `Clean Uncategorized` option. All files that are also present in another album, that is owned by the user, will be removed from the Uncategorized section.
