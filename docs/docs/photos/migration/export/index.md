7. **Sync continuously** : You can utilize Continuous Sync to eliminate manual
   exports each time new photos are added to Ente. This feature automatically
   detects new files and runs exports accordingly, It also ensures that exported
   data reflects the latest album states with new files, moves, and deletions.
