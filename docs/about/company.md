# About 
On February 1, 2020, Ente was born out of the necessity for a secure archival solution for personal photos and videos. Founded by Vishnu Mohandas in response to privacy concerns with major tech companies, Ente provides end-to-end encrypted apps across platforms.

The team at Ente aims to contribute to making the world a safer place for the preservation of personal memories. The road ahead is long, but the journey has started, fueled by a commitment to privacy and a deep sense of responsibility towards the users we serve.

In the realm of privacy and protection, we currently offer two products—Ente Photos and Ente Authenticator—with Ente Lockers set to join our lineup soon

# What does Ente mean? 
"Ente" holds dual significance for us. In Malayalam, the native language of our founder, it translates to "mine," giving "ente Photos" the direct meaning of "my photos." Additionally, our founder discovered that "ente" means "duck" in German. This unexpected connection led to the adoption of the duck as our mascot and we lovingly refer to our mascot as "Ducky,"
