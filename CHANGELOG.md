# CHANGELOG

## v1.6.41

### Added

- #### Hidden albums

    You can now hide albums, just like individual memories.

- #### Email verification

    We have now made email verification optional, so you can sign in with just your email address and password, without waiting for a verification code.

    You can opt in / out of email verification from Settings > Security.

- #### Download Album

    You can now chose the download location for downloading albums. Along with that we have also added progress bar for album download.

- #### Bug fixes & other enhancements

    We have squashed a few pesky bugs that were reported by our community
